# Event-Loop-Visualizer

🔁 JS Event Loop Visualizer
An interactive JavaScript Event Loop Visualizer that helps users understand the execution flow of the Call Stack, Task Queue, and Microtask Queue using an animated and educational interface.

**📌 Features**

🎯 Visual simulation of JavaScript's event loop.

🧠 Differentiates between Call Stack, Task Queue, and Microtask Queue.

⏱️ Adjustable execution speed with slider control.

🌈 Animated task execution with visual labels and glow effects.

📱 Fully responsive and mobile-friendly layout.

🧼 "Clear" button to reset simulation.

**⚙️ Built With**

**HTML5**

**CSS3**
  
  Custom colors: #273F4F, #447D9B, #D7D7D7
  
  Glow and fade effects
  
  Responsive media queries

**JavaScript**

  DOM manipulation
  
  Event handling
  
  Task simulation logic using setTimeout, Promise.then, queueMicrotask, etc.

**📝 Usage**
  
Click Run Simulation to animate the event loop execution.

Use the slider to control speed.

Press Clear to reset the visual state and timers.

Observe how Microtasks run before Task Queue once the Call Stack is clear.

**📄 Concepts Demonstrated**

This visualizer helps demonstrate:

JavaScript concurrency model

Call Stack lifecycle

Microtask vs Task scheduling

Execution order and priorities

**💡 Inspiration**

This project was created to simplify one of the most confusing JavaScript concepts — the Event Loop — through visualization and interaction.
